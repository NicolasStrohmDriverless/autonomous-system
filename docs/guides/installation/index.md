# Install

We propose three different Installation options to run this project on your machine.
We recommend using the DevContainer for the best experience.
Depending on your operating system, you can choose between the following options:

- [Windows](install_devcontainer_windows.md)
- [Linux and MacOS](install_devcontainer.md)

Alternatively, you can also set up a [local environment](install_local.md) (not recommended). Be aware that you will run into "it works on my machine" issues. This guide is here mostly for legacy reasons.
