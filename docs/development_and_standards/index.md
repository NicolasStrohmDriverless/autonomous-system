# Development and Standards

Welcome to the Development and Standards section of the Autonomous System. This section is dedicated to providing guidelines, best practices, and workflows that ensure consistency, efficiency, and quality throughout the development process. 

## Why Standards Matter

To streamline the process of contributing to our autonomous system, we've adopted standards that enhance code readability and establish clear communication protocols. These standards serve as guideposts, ensuring that every team member can easily understand and engage with the project. Following these guideposts and establishing a unified workflow ensures:

- **Consistency**: Making the code easier to read, understand, and maintain across the project.
- **Collaboration**: Improving collaboration among team members and reducing friction in the development process.
- **Maintainability**: Ensuring that future team members can easily onboard and continue development without major hurdles.
- **Reliability**: Minimizing bugs and improving the robustness of both software and hardware systems.
