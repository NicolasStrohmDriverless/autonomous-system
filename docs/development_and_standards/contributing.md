# Contributing

In order to keep the repo organized, there are some basic rules described here.

## Branch Naming Convention 

Contributors must create a branch prefixed with "dev-" followed by their name or identifier before making any changes. For example, "dev-johndoe". This will be your workspace, from which you can contribute by pulling and merging to the main branch.

## Clear Code Ownership 

Each contributor should clearly indicate ownership of their code changes within their branch and pull requests.

## Descriptive Commit Messages 

Commit messages should be clear, concise, and descriptive, summarizing the changes made in the commit. Please refer to the standardization [here]().


## Follow Coding Standards 

Even though we will be adding linting, you should orient your code to at least match earlier contributions. All code contributions must adhere to the established coding standards and guidelines of the project.

## Test Coverage 

!!!warning
    This will only become relevant when we establish a test structure.

New code contributions should be accompanied by appropriate tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Documentation Updates 

Any new major features should get their own documentation page. Changes to the codebase should be accompanied by updates to relevant documentation, including README files, MkDocs documentation, and Doxygen comments.

## Respect Version Control Workflow 

Contributors must follow the established version control workflow, including creating feature branches, submitting pull requests, and merging changes through merge requests.

## Review and Collaboration 

Every major change has to be reviewed. But communication is not only limited to finished features. Don't be afraid to ask and contribute during development.
