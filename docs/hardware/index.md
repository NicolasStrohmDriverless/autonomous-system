# Hardware

The software is often referred to as the "brain" of the autonomous vehicle. It processes sensor data, makes decisions, plans paths, and controls the vehicle’s movement. However, the hardware is just as critical, acting as the vehicle's "peripheral nervous system"—providing sensory input, executing decisions, and ensuring the car operates as expected in the physical world.

The hardware includes all the physical components that interact with the environment, enabling the software to perceive, compute, and control the car effectively. This includes the sensors that gather data from the world around the car, the actuators that control steering, throttle, and braking, and the computing units that process sensor data and run software algorithms.

Without reliable hardware, even the best software algorithms can't perform optimally. Each hardware component plays a specialized role:
